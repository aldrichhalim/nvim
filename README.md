# Neovim Config

My minimalist Neovim config: Vim + LSP + Defaults.

# Background

I've used to maintain a big Neovim config, consisting of 40+ plugins that I didn't really use.
While it's possible to customize your nvim to a full-fledged IDE, this comes with a cost:

- slower performance,
- key-mapping fatigue and configuration conflicts, and
- upgrading dependencies can break your entire editor.

In this repository, I'm recreating a stable and minimalist config. The approaches are:

- only install well-maintained and active plugins,
- embrace **default** key-bindings (Neovim has a lot already built-in) + vim motions, and
- keep it aesthetically pleasing.

# Requirements

- git
- ripgrep (rg): https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep

Please let me know if I'm missing out on other plugins that are essential
and discuss them in the "Issues" tab.
